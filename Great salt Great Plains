SALT PLAINS
salt grass average at 5 salt feet high, lay their territory across the plains, swaying blades seem endless when looking upon the horizon, the salt grass are sharp at the tip and curl in on themselves at the base where they store salt rain and other obejcts that are trapped in their salt suckle, they have little to no roots and only stand due to a single salt spire half the size of the blade that acts like a salt root.

salt rats lurk through the underbrush searching with their salt nose and feeling with their salt whiskers, a salt rats poison is enough to salt parslyze even those with the strongest immune system the effects last for on average a salt day and a half.
