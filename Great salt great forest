SALT TREES:
Salt roots spread outwards with this salt shards, the salt shards are thin and large for a large surface area, as such the 
salt roots are able to gather mineral salts from the ground.
the salt leaves, much like the salt roots are large and flat though each leaf is unique in the shards that spire from them,
when salt light hits the salt leaves, the salt leaves produce a salty sap which the tree stores in salt pores for energy 
throught the salt winters.
The salt sap is a rare and sought after commodity, its salt is some of the cleanest and purest refined by salt nature.
